Casino Game
Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a two-player game where the objective is to be the first to reach a total score of 100 points. Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points with each roll, but risking losing all their points for that turn if they roll a one.

Rules:
Objective: The goal is to reach a total score of 100 points or more.

Players: The game is played by two players taking alternating turns.

Gameplay:

On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die.
If the player rolls a:
1: The player's turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.
2-6: The number rolled is added to the player's current turn total.
The player has the option to "hold," which means they keep the points accumulated during their turn and pass the dice to the other player.
The turn ends when the player decides to hold or rolls a one.
Winning: The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
